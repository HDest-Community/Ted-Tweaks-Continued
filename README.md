# Ted Tweaks

A large collection of changes and 'tweaks' I've wanted to do to Hideous Destructor.
This always targets the latest unstable build of Hideous Destructor from <https://codeberg.org/mc776/HideousDestructor>! It will likely not work with any other version, and is not actively supported for any previous version.

Changes:

- Made *ERP repair require holding a button instead of spamming it.
- Removed Light Amplification Goggles forced FOV.
- Quieted down the jetpack and decreased its bulk.
- Decreased ladder weight.
- Added the compass changes from Cozi's Hideous Helmet fork.
- Improved Player Climbing.
- Cacodemon Corpse volume decreased.
- Modern Green turned into green instead of cyan.
- Blursphere no longer hides lite amp overlay.
- Blursphere now uses blurspheretexts lump again.
- Air Supply is now 90 seconds.
- Invulnerability Sphere now has a CVAR to disable spawning Necromancers, that being **hd_nonecroghost** and it defaults to 'false'.
- Keeper integration, patched for new wounds also and re-added keeping Blues on death along with a menu for it.
- Light corruption cards support.
- Light Amplification Goggles no longer flicker.
- IEDs no longer explode on dormant enemies.
- Flinching on enemy melee damage is decreased.
- Adds an unsuppressed variant of the SMG.
- Allows the revolver to stay cocked even if it is unselected.
- Makes the Liberator rifle hinder legs.
- Makes 7mm Ammunition rarer.
- Buffs 35mm damage.
- Makes the BFG expel more frag on attack.
- Includes a custom startup to show you're using Ted Tweaks.
- Remove the ledge check for player movement to reduce random slowdowns and make parkour easier.
- Adds a CVAR to remove all inheritors of HDDrug on mapchange or not.
- Adds an iron-sight variant to the Liberator rifle.
- Adds a grenade launcher to the SMG.
